# ProximalMenuPrototype

On a past contract they asked me to create a prototype for a radial menu that was aware of the app edge.  I worked with the designer to flesh out the intent for different scenarios and we went with my suggestion that taps along the edge become horizontal or vertical menus.  

This is a streamlined version of the original prototype with branding and client assets removed.

Tap anywhere on the screen to bring up a menu.  Each menu button is functional and will bring up a different object.  Note the objects are also proximity aware of the app edge.  

When you tap along the edge, note that the horizontal and vertical menus' animations change direction depending on their proximity to the corners.
